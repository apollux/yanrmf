# When I'm using default shell on Cygwin $(shell pwd) does not give the
# same result as $(shell echo $$PWD) or $(shell echo `pwd`).  It gives
# me path with symbolic links resolved whereas the later two do not do
# that.  I prefer unresolved version and since simple $(shell pwd) looks
# nicer than other two I'm sticking with bash :).
